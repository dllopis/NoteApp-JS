# NoteApp-JS
Basic note application with JavaScript/ HTML / CSS

Current Features and updates:
* hosted with github-pages: https://dllopis.github.io/NoteApp-JS/
* Notes are dynamically created and appended to DOM using JS.
* View and Delete button implemented with event listeners attached.
* Local storage implemented - Notes will load when browser opens.
* Replaced alert box prompt with pop up element to confirm deletion of note.
* Added background images to give life to note application.

Bugs / Issues noticed:
* Scale/fit background images accordingly
* Notes that reach the end of the screen will continue without scrolling.
* Viewing notes looks undesireable- pop-out with backdrop might be good.
